Data set: Replicated, urban-driven exposure to metallic trace elements in two passerines.

The meaning of the different variables is described below:

* Type = Habitat type (i.e. Center=city centre, Residential=residential area, Park=urban park, forest and Natural_park=protected forest)

* axis1_env = urbanization score computed from a Principal Component Analysis on the four environmental variables that were measured in this study: tree cover, impervious surface cover, distance to the closest road and distance to the city centre

* Age: 2Y = 1 year-old birds, A = 2 year-old or older birds

* Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, As, Hg = raw metallic trace element concentrations 

* log.cu, log.zn, log.pb, log.cd, log.as, log.hg = log-transformed metallic trace element concentrations after correction for below detection limit values
